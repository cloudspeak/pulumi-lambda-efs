# Helper function for creating Lambda functions which can read libraries
# which were installed to EFS using the scripts in this package.  Specifically,
# it returns the arguments which should be passed to a Pulumi `Function`
# constructor so that the function can access the libraries installed in an
# environment created by a `DevelopmentEnvironment` resource.
#
# It can be used in conjunction with the * operator like so:
#
# example_function = lambda_.Function("exampleFunction",
#   code="lambda.zip",
#   handler="handler.my_handler",
#   role=example_role.arn,
#   runtime="python3.8",
#   opts=ResourceOptions(depends_on=[environment]),
#   **get_environment_function_args(environment)
# )
#
# Note using the function in this way will overwite the `vpc_config`,
# `file_system_config` and `environment` parameters if they were present.
